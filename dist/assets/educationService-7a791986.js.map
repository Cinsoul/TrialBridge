Some trials require participants to be treatment-naïve, while others specifically seek participants who are already on certain medications.\\n\\nQ: Will I have to stop taking my current diabetes medication?\\nA: This varies by trial. Some trials may require you to discontinue current medications, while others may test new treatments in combination with standard care. Your safety is always the priority, and any medication changes will be carefully monitored.\\n\\nQ: What are the potential benefits of participating in a diabetes clinical trial?\\nA: Benefits may include access to new treatments, more frequent health monitoring, and contributing to advances in diabetes care.
